            Isn't it obvious Morty? I froze him. I'm your worst nightmare, bitch! You gotta shove these seeds way up your butt Morty, waay up there. Youâ€™re like Hitler, but even Hitler cared about Germany or something.</p>

            <p>Oh I say good sir, oh harumph, ohh a bope-a-dope-o-bobo. Holy crap, Morty, run! Run for your life, Morty, run! I-I've never seen that thing before in my life, Morty, I don't even know what the hell it is! We-we gotta get out of here, Morty, it's gonna kill us! We're gonna die, Morty! We're gonna die! We need a hang glider, and a crotch less uncle sam costume, and I want the entire field of your largest stadium covered end to end with naked red heads, and I want the stands packed with every man that remotely resembles my father. Wha, me irresponsible ?! All I wanted you to do was to hand me a screwdriver, Morty!</p>

            <p>It's a dream, Morty! We're in your dog's dream. The night the dogs captured us, after you cried and crapped your pants, we-we all went to sleep. Then I used my dream inceptors to put the two of us inside Snuffles' dream. My man! We don't whitewash it either, Morty. I mean, the pirates are really rapey. Not MY fault this is happening.</p>
